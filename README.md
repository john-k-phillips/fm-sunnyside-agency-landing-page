<!-- REPLACE TASKS -->
<h2>Overview</h2>
Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:
- [ ] View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- [x] See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

<!-- REPLACE LIST ITEMS -->
<h2>Satisfaction</h2>
<h3>The Good</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Modular SASS code, allows for quick changes and media queries.</li>
    <li>Navigation collapse bar with JS.</li>
  </ul>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The mobile version was okay, the desktop version is awful.</li>
    <li>Lack of focus but continued anyway...</li>
  </ul>

<!-- UPDATE ENTIRE SECTION -->
<h2>The Process</h2>
<h3>Tools</h3>

  <img alt="CSS3" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-CSS3-blue?style=flat-square&logo=css3&logoColor=white" />
  <img alt="JavaScript" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-JavaScript-ffd32b?style=flat-square&logo=JavaScript&logoColor=black" />
  
  <img alt="SASS" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-SASS-bf4080?style=flat-square&logo=sass&logoColor=white" />
</p>
<h3>What I Learnt</h3>
  <p>
    To be honest; I learnt to just stop working on projects when you're not completely focused, it was a bit silly for me to continue this.
    I should have taken a few steps back, perhaps a walk and revisited it.
  </p>
<h3>Continued Development</h3>
  <p>
    If I were to continue this project, I would likely redo most of the design (except for the hero section and navigation).
    I would make better use of the grid system rather than flex-wrapping.
